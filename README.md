Lab 0 - My Food Blog Project

This is my personal food blog showcasing my favorite recipes and baking adventures.

What's in each file:
- index.html - The main page with intro and latest recipes
- about.html - A bit about me and my cooking background
- recipes.html - Collection of my recipes with photos
- contact.html - A form to get in touch
- styles/main.scss - All the styling using SCSS
- images/ - Where I keep my food photos

Features I used:
- Bootstrap 4 for the layout
- SCSS for better styling (used variables and nesting)
- Recipe cards that pop up when clicked
- Optimized for mobile
